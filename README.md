React Quickly – Azat Mardan

In this book Azat Mardan had managed to walk me through the core concepts, eco system tools and libraries around React. My understanding on topics such as React, Redux, GraphQL, Webpack and Jest will be demonstrated in this repository through commenting on the projects of the book.

The projects in this book are not arbitrary projects, rather they are mini projects, yet powerful in putting that knowledge to practice. These tasks are essential and common in the realworld.


To prove my point:

"Imagine that you’re working on a unified visual framework that will be used in all of your company’s apps. Having the same look and feel in various apps is important." - Azat Mardan


Project 1:
Create a menu/application that reacts to user's role. If the user is a manager, then the menu will display only the neccessary links for the manager, else it displays for customers.This layout's header will be displayed across many pages.
