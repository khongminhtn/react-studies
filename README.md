React Quickly â€“ Azat Mardan

In this book Azat Mardan had managed to walk me through the core concepts, eco system tools and libraries around React. My understanding of React Stack; Redux, GraphQL, Webpack, React Router, Express.js, Node.js and Jest will be demonstrated in this repository through commenting on projects.

Projects in this book are not arbitrary projects, rather they are a combination of various project in scales. I see these tasks as tools that can be used in many more projects that I will be working on whether it is personally or professionally.

# Project Tools:
### Menu
Create a menu/application that reacts to user's role. If the user is a manager, then the menu will display only the neccessary links for the manager, else it displays for customers.This layout's header will be displayed across many pages.

### Tooltip Widget
Created a small pop up widget that essentially serve as a guidance for the users. This tool would be particularly useful for sites that contain a high amount of information.

### Timer component
Created a timer that has a some buttons for the timer to respond to. This is a very small and simple tool, yet I can see this tool being used in many many applications.

# React Libraries:
### Webpack
Webpack is a react module that allows bundling of assets to avoid uneccessary importing to html files, which could become a cluster. Assets such as JavaScript, CSS, Images, Data files can use external loaders to load assets to entry file and then import only that single entry script to the html.  

### React Routing
URL Routing solves some crucial problems with SPA;
- Refreshing exterminates current progress of page.
- Back button can exit the website and exterminate progress.
- Could not share precise content with friends.
- Search Engine could not index site (no distinct URL).
It solves this by configuring URL that does not map to a physical file. Only sematically meaningful to users. Incredibly useful for user experience and SEO.
