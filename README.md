React Quickly – Azat Mardan

In this book Azat Mardan had managed to walk me through the core concepts, eco system tools and libraries around React. My understanding of React Stack; Redux, GraphQL, Webpack, React Router, Exporess.js, Node.js and Jest will be demonstrated in this repository through commenting on projects.

Projects in this book are not arbitrary projects, rather they are a combination of various project in scales. I see these tasks as tools that can be used in many more projects that I will be working on whether it is personally or professionally.

# Tools:
---
### Menu:
Create a menu/application that reacts to user's role. If the user is a manager, then the menu will display only the neccessary links for the manager, else it displays for customers.This layout's header will be displayed across many pages.


---
### Tooltip Widget:
Created a small pop up widget that essentially serve as a guidance for the users. This tool would be particularly useful for sites that contain a high amount of information.


---
### Timer component:
Created a timer that has a some buttons for the timer to respond to. This is a very small and simple tool, yet I can see this tool being used in many many applications.
