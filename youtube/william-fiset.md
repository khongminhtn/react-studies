# Data Structure and Introduction  
 
### Data Structure  
- Organizing data so that it can be used efficiently
- Essential ingredients to create fast and powerful algorithm
- Make code cleaner and easier to understand

**Abstract Data Types**
- List
    - Linked List
    - Dynamic Array
- Queue
    - Linked List based queue
    - Array Based...
    - Stack based...

**Big O Notation**
- Deals with worst case scenario

- Binary Search Tree
    - Splits the list in half each time
    - this becomes O(log2(N)) => o(log(n))
 
**Dynamic and Static Arrays**
- Static Array
    - Indenxible fixed size array
    - Used everywhere
        - Temporarily store objects
        - Storing and accessing sequential data
        - Look up tables (because of index)
        - Used in dynamic programming
