# Algorithm  
**Linear Search**  
- Loops through a list, checking each value to match the search value
- Not the most efficient search algorithm
- Good for expected search value to be at the beginning of list
- Good for small list
- Good for unsorted list 
- Best Case:
    - First in List O(1)
- Worst Case: 
    - Last in list O(n)
    - Not in List

**Binary Search**  
- Specialised for sorted arrays
- Splitting list in half
- Time Complexity is O(log N).
