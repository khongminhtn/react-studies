**Big O**
Understanding the efficiency of an algorithm
- O(1) Performs 1 operation
- O(N) Perform N operation where N is length of input
- O(2N) When input is multiplied
- O(log(N)) When input is divided
- O(N^2) when input is exponential (nested arrays)
Recursion that makes multiple call has complexity of O(branches^depth)
